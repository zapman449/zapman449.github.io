# Clouds and Vendor Lock-in

An oft repeated refrain is "We should be cloud agnostic" or "We should support multiple cloud vendors".

We apparently still fighting the last war (with apologies to Terry Goodkind).

### The Previous War

In the "last war" we learned how bad of an idea it was to choose vendors with de facto monopoly power.  Microsoft
typified this challenge.  You paid for the OS. You paid for the developer tools, you paid for the office suite, and
you paid for the Exchange Servers, and you paid in time, frustration and moral for the terrible tools you paid 
vast sums of money for<sup>1</sup>.

The problem here was frequently described as 'vendor lock-in'.  But in actuality, it was two distinct, but related
problems: 
1. Poor vendor selection
2. Lack of available vendors

The companies choosing to get into bed with Microsoft could see what was happening to their neighboring companies.
They could clearly see the high fees being racked up, and the costs going out the door.  Yet they chose Microsoft
regardless.  Partially this was due to everyone else doing this.  However...

Microsoft was also eating all of it's competitors.  Lotus 1-2-3 was famous.  Ami Pro was fantastic.  Word Perfect SILL
lives on, on life support from the legal community.  But they were all victims of Embrace and Extend.  And at best,
they are shadows of their former selves.

### Cloud Lock-in

The other reason people ask for "cloud agnosticism" is the example of Nirvanix, who shut down spectacularly in 2013.
Between the announcement, and the shutdown, Nirvanix did not have sufficient bandwidth for customers to exfiltrate
all their data.  It was mathematically impossible.

That is obviously bad.  However this too is more an example of bad vendor selection than vendor lock-in.  

Nirvanix offered prices which were wildly lower than AWS.  Or Google.  Or Rackspace, or anyone else that I recall.
These prices were described in the press as "Too good to be true".  And they were... which lead to bankruptcy.

<sup>1</sup> In Microsoft's defense, their tools have vastly improved since the early 2000s, and they have responded
to these problems admirably.  But Microsoft longer wields monopoly power either.
