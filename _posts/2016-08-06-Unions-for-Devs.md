## With a dash of history, politics and centrist thinking

#### Framing the discussion

Yesterday a slack team I followed had an interesting discussion of unions for developers.  All the usual
suspects came out:
* Those who think unions are a cure for several ills plaguing society
* Those who think unions are a massive drain on society
* Those who tried to get the discussion out of these well worn trenches.

Unfortunately any discussion of unions is difficult because of how politicised they are (For reference this
post is focused on US Politics.  Other perspectives welcome.)  No discussion of unions can avoid these
treacherous waters.

#### The Case for Unions for Devs

In some companies, developers (and especially operations) have tendencies towards extremely long hours and
underpay.  These are the classic reasons for forming unions.  So lets look into unions.

#### An extremely brief history

In the beginning, corporations had vast power, because they had the money.  People needed the money to live,
corporations viewed most people as interchangeable, and worse job mobility was frequently constrained.

So the people were treated like trash.

As these forces sharpened, the only way the people could fight back was to organize themselves into a larger
unit.  Individually, they were replaceable.  But when a plurality of workers could organize, they found
improved leverage.  These unions provided society with huge boons: Child labor ceased to be a thing.  Wages
increased significantly, and life got better.

Unfortunately, Unions don't have any way to disband once their aims have been reached:  "Bureaucracy must
increase to serve the needs of increasing bureaucracy."  Once 'management' has been painted as the public
enemy, there's no reconciliation.

Which leads us to where we are today.  Here are some examples:

Union rules frequently prevent people doing even simple tasks... like moving their desks even inches.  My
father once got in trouble with the teamsters union when he moved his desk to where it was supposed to go...
which was 3 inches.  

Union negotiations get extremely dangerous to those involved.  A friend of mine was chief counsel for a
company in New York.  The union wanted to scare him, so a convoy of cars drove by his house, and did a
drive-by shooting... while he and his family were there.  My friend proceeded to have a private discussion
with the head of the union and threaten his life if that ever happened again.  The real kicker of this?
My friend is a deacon.  A deacon threatening the life of someone is rather rare.  And lest you think this
happened in days of yore, nope.  Early 2000's.

Unions must pay for themselves, and must pay their members strike-insurance for when work-stoppages are
required, so wages are reduced to cover these expenses.

Unions hold some portion of the blame for the malaise of the US Automaking industry.  Their inflexible and
intransigent negotiating style hindered the companies from making needed financial reforms to remain
competitive.

So, unions have a beautiful historical narrative, coupled with a problematic current status.  Which leads us
to modern politics.

#### Politics and the modern union

This topic is nuanced, but I'm going to shorten it extremely to get closer to what I actually want to talk
about.  Unions fund leftist candidates.  So Democrats love them, and Republicans hate them.

And this situation has gone on for years, so it falls into the civic religion of modern politics.

What?
